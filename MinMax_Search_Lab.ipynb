It just skips that whole part of the tree.\n",

        "\n",
        "   *   Minimax looks at possible future moves to find the best one. Even in a simple game like Tic Tac Toe, there are many different ways the game can go from any point. Minimax explores these many paths (states) to figure out the value of each move. It needs to look ahead to predict what the other player will do and what the final result might be.\n",

        "2. Difference between full tree size and actual explored states?\n",
        "\n",
        "   *   The \"full tree size\" is the total number of all possible game situations (states) you could reach.\n",
        "   *   The \"actual explored states\" is the number of states Minimax actually looked at.\n",
        "   *   The actual number is smaller because Minimax is smart. It stops looking down paths that are clearly bad or where the game ends early (like a win or loss).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. How do early wins reduce the number of states?\n",
        "\n",
        "   *   If one player wins the game before the board is full, the game ends right there.\n",
        "   *   Minimax sees this win (a \"terminal state\") and knows the value of that path. It doesn't need to explore any more moves that could happen *after* the win.\n",
        "   *   Stopping exploration early in winning or losing branches cuts down the total number of states that Minimax has to check.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What challenges would arise if applying Minimax to Chess?\n",
        "\n",
        "   *   **Many more moves:** In Chess, there are a huge number of possible moves you can make from almost any position, much more than in Tic Tac Toe.\n",
        "   *   **Very long games:** Chess games can last for many, many moves.\n",
        "   *   **Huge number of states:** Because of many moves and long games, the total number of possible Chess games (and states) is incredibly massive.\n",
        "   *   **Too slow:** Minimax has to explore a big part of this tree. For Chess, the tree is so big that exploring it fully (or even to a good depth) takes too much time and computer power. It's not practical to use simple Minimax for Chess."
